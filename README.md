Electron Document Keyshort Demo
==========================

It's the same as normal html page to capture keyshorts.

Update: browser built-in handling of keyboard events is not easy to use,
now use a library 'keymaster'.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Press any key, you will see logs on the window.
